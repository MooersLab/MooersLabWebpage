# The Blaine Mooers Lab

Located at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences in Oklahoma City since 2006.

## Research Interests

The Mooers lab focuses on studying the role of RNA structure in RNA editing in the mitochondrion of trypanosomes. 
Our principle method is biomolecular crystallography. 
Secondary methods include small angle X-ray scattering, molecular dynamics simulations, and virtual drug docking. 

We have access to a local X-ray source for screening crystals.
We are also heavy users of synchrotron radiation at SSRL and sometimes ALS and NSLSII.
Dr Mooers serves on the SSRL User Executive Committee, which organizes a fascinating user meeting every year.
He co-chaired a workshop on "Machine Learning in the Structural Sciences" at the 2020 meeting.

We also work on advancing the methodology of biomolecular crystallography. 
Recent achievements include the ab initio direct methods structure determination of the largest nucleic acid to date. 
This acheivement was made in spite of the presence of two orders of translational pseudosymmetry, which hindered structure determination. 
This work required extensive supercomputer use, especially the trials starting from random phases that were required to obtain a meaningful sample size. 

Our other area of interest that is computationally intensive is the structure-based drug design targeting RNAs in our trypanosome work and proteins important in RNA editing, influenza, and cancer. 
The protein work is done collaboration with colleagues at OUHSC and Texas A&M University. 
We also develop software tools to ease the production of molecular graphics images with PyMOL.
